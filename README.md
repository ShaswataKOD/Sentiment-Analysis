## 🛠️ 3. Data Preprocessing
Given the large dataset, **preprocessing efficiency** is a priority:

✅ **Reduced chunk size** to **32K** data points for fast processing.  
✅ **No missing values** detected.  
✅ **Insignificant duplicate values** removed to optimize performance.  
✅ **Key features used**:
   - 📌 `labels` (Target variable, binary classification)
   - 📌 `text_data` (Tweet content for analysis)
✅ **Stemming applied** to retain the inherent meaning of words while speeding up processing.  
✅ **TF-IDF Vectorization** used for feature extraction, ensuring robust encoding of textual data.
